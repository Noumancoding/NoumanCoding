# Hello, I'm Nouman

Iâ€™m learning frontend development from the beginning.

Right now, I know HTML and CSS. I build small websites and practice daily.

I only write my own code. No AI, no copy-paste.

My goal is to get a real remote frontend job by September 2025.

I keep learning one step at a time.

You can check my public projects. They are real and simple.
