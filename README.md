# 👋 Hi, I’m Muhammad Nouman Ali

I'm a **Front-End Developer** focused on building clean and responsive websites using **HTML5, CSS3, Git**, and currently learning **JavaScript**.

Since June 2025, I’ve developed several real-world projects — each one hand-coded and deployed live to practice layout, structure, and clean UI design.
